# BIO322 - Machine Learning project - Classification
Welcome to our Machine Learning project. Here you can use our code to predict whether an odour is perceived as more sweet or more sour.

## Team members 
* Alexander Popescu
* Changling Li

## Organisation
The project is contained in the repository BIO322-Classification. You can find :
* a repository **data** that contains the data sets used to train and predict the outcomes
* a repository **src** that contains our code (in the form of R scripts) that contains the code for :
  * Exploration : we explored the data and visualize it
  * Linear method : The code used to produce our best results with logistic regression
  * Non-linear method : The code used to produce our best results with neural networks,SVM trees and random forests.
* a repository **plots** that contains all the plots produced during the data exploration.
* our best results produced for the Kaggle competition in a .csv file 

## How to run our code
**R version is 4.0.3**
In order to run our R scripts, please go to the repository BIO322-Classification.
